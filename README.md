# Wagtail test CMS
I was trying out [this](https://docs.wagtail.org/en/stable/getting_started/tutorial.html).
```bash
# navigate somewhere preferrable for storing this stuff
# do a git clone
# and than this:
python -m venv wagtail-venv # venv is built-in python tool
# source ./wagtail-venv/bin/activate
## either or
. ./wagtail-venv/bin/activate
cd mysite
pip install -r requirements.txt
python manage.py runserver
```
Content here has a lot of gibberish text so don't take this seriousely. Just wanted to see how this works.
